RUN npm ci --only=production
COPY . .
EXPOSE 3978
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

### Environment Configuration
- Set all required environment variables

- **HTTPS**: Use HTTPS in production for secure communication
- **Admin Endpoints**: Remove or secure admin endpoints in production

## üìà Monitoring and Maintenance

### Health Monitoring
The `/health` endpoint provides:
- Service status
- Uptime information
- Scheduler status
- Next scheduled job times

### Database Maintenance
- Regular database backups
